 help me update droidos launcher and kb. i need to fix the auto adjust margin for ime toggle in lajncher, the  auto resize apps and sync with droidos bottom margin toggles in keyboard app. i have ben trying to fix but its extremely difficult as they are all kind of relatedand changing one often breaks another. they all woek together to.get keyboard auto bide/unhide and full screen android apps and tiled droidos apps to adjust margin height. help me rix, but be extremely caredul not to break othernmodes.here is aresult of my baseljne testing of where we are at with current code.


1. Mode: No auto adjust margin, no DroirOS IME (ie Gboard) (used for tiled apps and no droidos kb overlay or ime)
- Status: open issue 
- Issues: in 4 app quad, when text input focused, only 1 bottom row app resizes margin, not both. works properly with droidos ime though 
- Tested, Full screen apps, 2 tiled top bottom, 4 apps quad/corner 
- Goal: no margjn adjustment at all by droidos, only by android ime. tiled apps adjust height from androir ime kb focus.

2. Mode: No auto adjust margin, wiih DroidOS IME (used for droidos floating kb/not ddocked or wkth a hardware kb)

- Status: working as expected 
- Issues: none 
- Tested, Full screen apps, 2 tiled top bottom, 4 apps quad/corner 
- Goal: no margin adjustment from droidos or from jme. tiled apps and android full screen apps should never adjust height.

3. Mode: Auto adjust margin, no DroirOS IME (ie Gboard) (there is no use case for this, shoule be disabled)
- Status: open minor issue
- Issues: if droidos ime kb is not active, lets disable/grey this option out from being activated 
- Tested, Full screen apps, 2 tiled top bottom, 4 apps quad/corner 
- Goal: deactivate this mode

4. Mode: Auto adjust margin, DroidOS IME  auto resize apps (used for full screen app with DroidOS overlay docked)
- Status: open minor issue
- Issues: margin changes in ime kb doesnt take effect until auto resize apps toggled on and off
- Tested, Full screen apps, 2 tiled top bottom, 4 apps quad/corner
- Goal: app height margjn adjusts and kb overlay hides/unhided automatically when text jnput fields are unfocused/focused.  

5. Mode: Auto adjust margin, DroidOS IME (ie Gboard), auto resize apps, sync with droiros margin (used for both full screen androjd apps and droidos tiled apps to auto adjustbmartin for docked overlay kb)
- Status: open issue
- Issues: full screen apps tempermental at unhidjng kb/reeizing height of app shorter (mostly doeent work). i can see thr app stutter like it tries, but nothingg ends up changing. full screen app does not resize larger or hide kb when losing text focus. it also dooes not change whem i manually hide kb bh pressing bubble kb icon or using hide kb button  on kb.
- Tested, Full screen apps, 2 tiled top bottom, 4 apps quad/corner
